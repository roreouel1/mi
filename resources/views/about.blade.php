            How to Create Your Own Paper Money… Legally…
And Beat the Banks at Their Own Game!

            </h3>

    
            <p class="yellow">
            I know four forms of creating/printing money: currency, credit, scrip, and ROI.
            </p>

            <p>
            Here, I am going to show you how to create your own money and not end up in jail. This is not a bribe to get you to stay on my website. There are no hooks, catches, or fine print. I will really show you not just how to make but create money that is real and has intrinsic value.
            </p>


           <p class="yellow">
           Many are being crushed financially between the jaws of a deadly vise: On one side, unemployment, recession, foreign competition and other economic maladies limit our ability to earn more; on the other side, our own government through direct and indirect taxation, inflation, regulation, and other ruinous economic policies, makes the money we receive worth less and less.
            </p>
       
            <p>
            You will perform this small miracle, not through alchemy or counterfeiting, but by starting your own monetary system. Your “private” money will be scrip, issued by you and backed by goods and services that you control.
            </p>
 
          <p>But first, let us start with definitions. Webster’s defines money as follows:</p>

          <p>Money: noun: Something generally accepted. As a medium of exchange, a measure of value, or a means of payment.

            It is interesting how definitions change with time. Not too long ago, money was also expected to be a “store of value.” To some, the difference between a “measure” of value and a “store” of value may seem small. It indicates that when money no longer fits the definition – when it no longer represents a stored value of gold or silver, and could no longer be redeemed for those metals – the definition had to be changed. 
            </p>

            <p class="yellow">Currency, on the other hand, is much easier to describe. It need only serve as a medium of exchange. Although generally thought of in terms of coins and paper, currency can be just about anything – goods or services, as well as paper. While value is an important factor, negotiability is the key.</p>
            
            <p>Now for another definition from Webster’s:</p>

            <p>
            Scrip: noun: 1: Any of various documents used as evidence that the holder or bearer is entitles to receive something; 2: Paper currency or a token issued or temporary use.
            </p>
            <p>
              
            </p>
            <p>
            Therefore, scrip is currency and it is also money – a private money, yes, but money nonetheless. In fact, it generally contains something you don’t see on public money any more: a promise to pay. Scrip is nothing more than an IOU – a promise to render specified goods and services to the bearer at some future date.
            </p>
            <p>
            Actually, scrip should be no stranger to you. If you have ever collected trading stamps, received or given a gift certificate, or clipped discount coupons from newspapers or magazines, you have used scrip. The only difference is that it probably never occurred to you that you could also issue scrip. 
            </p>
            <h3>How Scrip Works</h3>
            <p class="yellow">
            Scrip is best used in a barter transaction. For example, assume you own a furniture store. You do a respectable business, but it is not as good as it could be. Your inventory is larger than it should be. You are not moving merchandise fast enough. You would like to increase your business, but you really cannot afford to cut prices much. Nor do you have the cash flow to increase your advertising.
            </p>
            <p>
            Scrip can be the answer to all your problems. It enables you lower your overhead, by trading scrip for things you would normally have to pay for with cash. That could include everything from office supplies to janitorial services to medical to dental services. It could cover the repairs to your house. You might even consider issuing scrip in lieu of cash Christmas bonuses. You can even use scrip to pay for the increased advertising campaign you didn’t think you could afford.
            </p>
            <p>
            Scrip has some hidden advantages too. It is transferable, so it makes three-way (or more) exchanges not only possible by practical. It is something you can add to transactions to balance equities.
            </p>

            

          <h3>Barter Scrip</h3>
          <p class="toper">
          The XYZ Furniture company on this day (date), does hereby agree to permit bearer to redeem this scrip for £(amount), retail price, of merchandise in the store.
          </p>
          
          <p class="yellow">This scrip is 100% transferable, but must be redeemed by (date).<br>

Issued by: _______________________________<br>
        (store name and address)
</p>

          <p class="yellow">
         
	For: ____________________________________

          </p>

          <p>
          Other terms or specifications often printed on scrip include: all appropriate taxes and tips must be paid in cash; no change will be given if less than the face amount is used; and, reservations or appointments must be scheduled a certain number of days or weeks in advance.
          </p>

          <p>
          If you are a merchant, you can specify the type of merchandise that may be taken (or not taken) in scrip. Take care, however, not to make the terms so restrictive as to inhibit trade.
          </p>

          <h3>
          What If Time Is Your Inventory?
          </h3>

          <p class="yellow">
          Time is money. There is a lot of truth in that overworked expression. Your time, particularly if you are either a skilled craftsman (carpenter, plumber, welder, electrician, etc.) or professional (doctor, dentist, attorney, accountant, etc.), is most definitely a store of value for you. Those talents and skills are, figuratively and literally, money in the bank. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Your time is perhaps the most perishable commodity you own. When it is gone, it is gone! There are no ways to recapture lost or wasted time.
          </p>
          
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-6 pt-4 pt-lg-0 order-2 order-lg-1 content" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="100">
          <p class="toper">
          Skilled craftsmen get paid by the hour. When they are working, they earn money; when they are not, they do not. Ask the average plumber or carpenter, and he will tell you that he works at most about seventy percent of the time he could. They may claim that they would rather go swimming or play golf every Friday, but the truth is that, the business just isn’t there. They lose thirty percent of their time, and along with it, thirty percent of their potential income.
          </p>
         
          
          <p class="yellow">
          Professionals, particularly those just starting out, are in the same boat. They generally do not like to admit it they, too, get paid by the hour. And like skilled craftsmen, they find it impossible to maximize their potential earnings by getting paid for one hundred percent of their working time.
          </p>
          <p class="fst-italic">
          By issuing scrip, you can avoid losing that time and money. You can maximize your profits without advertising or cutting rates.
          </p>
          <p>
          To show you how it works, let us use the dentist and the furniture dealer as an example.
          </p>
          
          
          <img src="{{asset('assets/img/bundle.jpg')}}" class="img-fluid" alt="">

          <h3>The Dentist And The Furniture Dealer</h3>
          <p>
          The young dentist just starting his practice needs £3,000 in office furniture. Because he hasn’t got the cash and doesn’t want to overextend his credit, he is willing to exchange dental services of comparable value. Finding a willing partner to the exchange (our furniture dealer), he is immediately able to furnish his office, by giving the dealer £3,000 worth of his services.
          </p>
          <p class="yellow">
          The furniture dealer at the time of the exchange can only use £500 of dental services for his family, however, that takes care of all the X-rays, fillings, and cleanings he needs. Therefore, he needs something to show that the dentist still owes him £2,500 worth of future dental care.
          </p>

          <p>
          The dentist does this by issuing him scrip – literally, a paper IOU or promise to pay. They both agree that the scrip is collectible within the next two years at the dentist’s then-going rate. Also, that the furniture dealer can transfer the scrip to anyone he chooses. These agreements are stipulated in the scrip. So the dentist gets his furniture, the dealer has received £500 worth of dental services he did not have to pay cash for, and he has £2,500 in scrip, which promises services any time within the following two years.
          </p>
           <h3>How To Spend Scrip</h3>
          <p>
          After you learn how to create “money,” the next step is learning how to spend it. Since scrip is money, you spend it exactly the same way. The key is to find people who recognize the inherent value of the scrip and who will accept it instead of cash.
          </p>
          <p>
          To understand why someone might be willing to do that, or even prefer scrip to cash, you must switch positions for a moment and think of yourself as the recipient, rather than the issuer, of the scrip. Let us return to our dentist and furniture dealer for a moment.
          </p>
          <p class="yellow">
          Again, assume that you own the furniture store and a dentist has just offered to “buy” £3,000 worth of furniture, but he wants to pay you in scrip rather than cash. Before you ask him to leave your store consider the offer carefully. First, since the dentist can’t (or won’t) pay cash, you have just lost £3,000 worth of new business if you turn him down. Second, it can be a chance to move excess inventory without discounting. You might even get the dentist to agree that you specify which furniture he may take. And finally, when you trade with scrip at retail-to-retail value, it is like getting a fifty percent discount off your dental bills (the mark-up on your furniture).
          </p>
          <p>
          All in all, it is beginning to look like a pretty good deal for you, except for one thing: You know that you cannot use £3,000 worth of dental services in the reasonable future.
          </p>
          <p class="yellow">
          That is why the scrip must be transferable. You can use it to trade for other goods or services. And if you really are tight-fisted, and want to at least cover your out-of-pocket costs, you can always try to negotiate a part-cash/part-scrip arrangement.
          </p>
          <p>
          That is how you get non-traders introduced to the idea of scrip. It takes a little brass and sometimes people will turn you down. But it won’t cost you anything to try.
          </p>
          <p class="yellow">
          Trading scrip with fellow barterers is much easier. Many of them have probably already ‘bought’ and “sold” scrip already, so it won’t be a new idea to them.
          </p>

          <h3>Two Pitfalls To Avoid.</h3>
          <p>
          Starting your own monetary system is surprisingly easy, but there are two pitfalls you should avoid. One is inflation. If you are not careful, you can devalue or even discredit your own currency, by printing too much of it or by making it too difficult to redeem. Secondly, make sure your scrip is backed by your time or inventory. There are limited quantities of both.
          </p>
          
          <p class="yellow">While you can follow the examples of airlines or restaurants and overbook by fifteen to twenty percent, knowing that at least that much of it will never be used (the “breakage” we discussed earlier), some discretion is required.</p>
         
          <p>Don’t make promises you aren’t prepared to keep…else…I will personally make sure you end up in jail!</p>
